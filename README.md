# anacapa-proposed-project-format
In submit.cs, project config was in database.  We propose to do it in github repo.


In THIS repo, each subdirectory represents what the TOP level might look like in a project repo.   

The very level has a subdirectory for each proposed structure, e.g.

```
 proposal1
 proposal2
 etc.
```

The next level will be a directory for each course in the current set of courses

e.g
. 
```
 cs32_s15
 cs32_f15
 etc.
```

The next level will be each project in that course, e.g.

```
 lab00
 lab01
 lab02
 etc.
```
